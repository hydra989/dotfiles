My setups also utilize a handful of tools such as dwm and firefox, the configs for
which either aren't included or can be found elsewhere.

*** nix
- canary: barebones dev environment, made with proxmox in mind, ethernet
- songbird: less minimal dev env + steam setup, wifi, bluetooth, power management emphasis

configuration.nix loads the machine active-machine.nix, which is a hardlink to one of the
machine files in the nix/machines folder. bookkeeper manages this for me, ensuring the
active machine matches the hostname.
