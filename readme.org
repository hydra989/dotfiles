*** nix
- canary: barebones dev environment, made with proxmox in mind, ethernet
- songbird: less minimal dev env + steam setup, wifi, bluetooth, power management emphasis

configuration.nix isn't modular in nature---to swap between the configs, edit the source code.
all it takes is commenting one line out and uncommenting the other.
