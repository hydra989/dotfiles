My elisp files are split up into an init.el and a src/ directory,
in which are a small handful of elisp files (named *.init.el, to better
distinguish them) that init.el loads on startup.

Wallpapers I collect over time, so note that they aren't mine/I didn't make them. I've
tried to collect their sources in a sources.txt over time, but it'll likely be somewhat
of a mess at any given time.

*** notes

- polybar colors are hardcoded to cyberpunk theme---could redo and use xresources colors
  that pywal generates on emacs theme switch
