My emacs configuration is literate; find its .org file [[https://github.com/hhydraa/dotfiles/blob/master/.emacs.d/config.org][here]].

Wallpapers I collect over time, so note that they aren't mine/I didn't make them.
I've tried to collect their sources in a text file over time, but it'll likely
be somewhat of a mess at any given time.

*** notes

- polybar colors are hardcoded to cyberpunk theme---could redo and use xresources colors
  that pywal generates on emacs theme switch
